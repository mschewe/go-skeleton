Go Skeleton for Projects with multiple files
===========================================

This aims to be an example for a multi file project in go. But somehow I can't get it working. 
I have asked at [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21733704/organizing-a-multiple-file-go-project-with-private-support-files) how to do the imports the right way, but after trying all kind of permutations and combinations I thought I create this repository and ask again for help.

It would be great if someone could show me how to do it the right way! :thumbsup:
